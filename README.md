## Why Remindify?  

We’ve all been there: forgetting a loved one’s birthday, missing a deadline, or scrambling last-minute because a meeting slipped through the cracks. The tools we typically rely on, like calendar apps, are often cluttered with tasks and events, making it harder to focus on what's truly important.  

Remindify was built to address this problem by providing a lightweight, user-friendly solution that focuses solely on reminders. With features like recurring events, customizable notifications, and integration with Telegram, it’s a modern solution for personal and professional organization.
